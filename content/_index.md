# Using Edge Functions to handle Rewrites and Redirects

### Overview

In this workshop, we will learn how to handle common **redirect** and **rewrite** scenarios using **Edge Compute** features provided by AWS.

The main goal of this is to provide viewers with knowledge on how to use Edge Compute features to apply redirects to their applications and understand how to use those features most effectively.

This workshop is where you will perform labs using the **Compute platforms** available in CloudFront to access different redirects and rewrites. Here we will use **Lambda@Edge** because the responses from these instances are cacheable responses.

### Prerequisites

To complete this workshop, we need knowledge of CDNs and basic JavaScript/Python programming knowledge to understand the code and knowledge throughout the workshop.
