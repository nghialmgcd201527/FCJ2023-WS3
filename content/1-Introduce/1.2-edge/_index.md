Before starting the lab, we should have a basic understanding of the type of edge compute capabilities we will use in this lab, currently available in CloudFront.

#### CloudFront Edge Compute Features

[**Lambda@Edge:**](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/edge/) This is a feature of [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) allows you to run code closer to the users of your application, improving performance and reducing latency. With **Lambda@Edge,** we don't have to provision or manage infrastructure in multiple locations around the world. We only pay for the compute time we use and not when our code is not in use. With **Lambda@Edge,** we can enrich our web applications by distributing them globally and improving their performance - all without the need for server administration. **Lambda@Edge** runs our code in response to events generated by the Amazon CloudFront content delivery network. Simply upload our code to AWS Lambda, which will handle everything needed to run and scale our code with high availability at an AWS location closest to our end user.

#### CloudFront Edge Compute Triggers

Amazon CloudFront requires four different event types for custom requests and responses to be exchanged between the viewer and the server (origin).

1. **Viewer Request** - This function executes when CloudFront receives a request from the viewer and before it checks whether the requested object is in the edge cache or not.

2. **Origin Request** - This function only executes when CloudFront forwards the request to our origin. When the request object is in the edge cache, the function is not executed.

3. **Origin Response** - This function executes after CloudFront receives the response from the origin and before it caches the object in the response.

4. **Viewer Response** - Function executes before returning the requested object to the viewer. The function executes regardless of whether the object is in the edge cache or not.

All the above 4 trigger options are available with **Lambda@Edge** while only **viewer triggers** are available with **CloudFront Functions.** This is one of the most important and important differences between the above two features and we will explore more about the **Lambda@Edge** feature throughout the workshop.

#### CloudFront Edge Locations v√† Regional Edge Caches (RECs)

[**CloudFront Edge Locations**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Introduction.html) are points of presence where user requests will be sent based on latency lowest for the user sending that request. The content of **CloudFront Delivers** is detected by which Edge Locations can serve requests and route users to the identified Edge Locations.

[**Regional Edge Cache**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/HowCloudFrontWorks.html#CloudFrontRegionaledgecaches) is the middle tier caching layer between **Edge Location** and **Origin.** **Regional Edge Cache servers** are used to allow more content to be cached closer to the user.

The following diagram shows how the **Edge Locations** and **Regional Edge Cache** groups are used by CloudFront:
